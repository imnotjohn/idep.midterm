0,Film,"A film – also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or (slang) flick – is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations. The word ""cinema"", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.","['film,0.06911999732255936,0.22158999741077423,-0.666130006313324,-0.1406099945306778,0.06336499750614166,0.4174700081348419,-0.21723000705242157,-1.0400999784469604,0.026069000363349915,1.3381999731063843,-0.08364199846982956,0.6632400155067444,-0.4598900079727173,0.9588299989700317,1.31850004196167,-0.6252300143241882,0.5615299940109253,0.6528800129890442,-1.2364000082015991,0.2969200015068054,1.2380000352859497,0.8062099814414978,0.40966999530792236,0.39945000410079956,0.5798299908638,-1.3658000230789185,-1.6763999462127686,0.06971800327301025,-0.596340000629425,-0.6311699748039246,2.589400053024292,-0.5691499710083008,0.4687899947166443,-0.9248999953269958,-0.446289986371994,0.4228299856185913,0.17636999487876892,-0.01445899996906519,-0.7535799741744995,-0.9785000085830688,0.023074999451637268,1.2226999998092651,-0.17517000436782837,-1.5743000507354736,-0.953499972820282,-0.10959000140428543,0.245169997215271,-0.935509979724884,-0.20942999422550201,0.6733300089836121']"
1,Photograph,"A photograph is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are now created using a smartphone/camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.","['photograph,-0.05618499964475632,1.0160000324249268,0.4114600121974945,-0.3913100063800812,0.9198600053787231,-0.017666000872850418,-1.0757999420166016,-0.6164600253105164,0.29690998792648315,-0.2931100130081177,-0.05523199960589409,-0.15626999735832214,0.18752999603748322,0.6534900069236755,0.5967199802398682,-0.2364799976348877,-1.1749000549316406,-0.6941499710083008,-0.2496200054883957,-0.32958000898361206,0.25672999024391174,0.6438199877738953,0.16288000345230103,-0.3623799979686737,0.41527000069618225,-1.113700032234192,-1.3141000270843506,0.8557599782943726,0.2621400058269501,-0.5308399796485901,0.8670600056648254,-0.7618899941444397,-0.3523400127887726,-1.180799961090088,-0.5215399861335754,0.7844399809837341,0.5795199871063232,0.0995590016245842,-1.003000020980835,-0.6442899703979492,1.0144000053405762,0.2879300117492676,-0.04956899955868721,-0.2948000133037567,0.2798199951648712,-0.7367299795150757,0.10894999653100967,-0.7937099933624268,0.30583998560905457,-0.7108500003814697']"
2,Sovereignty,"Sovereignty is the defining authority within individual consciousness, social construct, or territory. Sovereignty entails hierarchy within the state, as well as external autonomy for states. In any state, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body, or institution that has the ultimate authority over other people in order to establish a law or change existing laws. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some polity. In international law, sovereignty is the exercise of power by a state. De jure sovereignty refers to the legal right to do so; de facto sovereignty refers to the factual ability to do so. This can become an issue of special concern upon the failure of the usual expectation that de jure and de facto sovereignty exist at the place and time of concern, and reside within the same organization.","['sovereignty,-0.3148300051689148,0.05750099942088127,-0.780239999294281,0.9412400126457214,1.079200029373169,-0.13835999369621277,0.8385800123214722,0.6244400143623352,0.21480999886989594,-0.753849983215332,0.692520022392273,-0.013925000093877316,0.390610009431839,-0.32763999700546265,-0.44815000891685486,1.1025999784469604,0.5408700108528137,-1.200700044631958,0.5633599758148193,0.6451399922370911,-0.09165800362825394,0.4754599928855896,-0.614139974117279,-1.0361000299453735,0.49529001116752625,-1.4773999452590942,-0.21252000331878662,-0.08385799825191498,1.0140999555587769,0.4946399927139282,2.151599884033203,-0.05485299974679947,-1.422700047492981,-0.021181000396609306,-1.1634999513626099,-0.8316400051116943,-0.4457800090312958,-0.9611999988555908,-1.5286999940872192,0.06392499804496765,-0.22359000146389008,-0.7712399959564209,0.8989499807357788,-0.006519199814647436,-1.968500018119812,-0.5038099884986877,-1.1547000408172607,0.7778900265693665,0.011005000211298466,-1.1740000247955322']"

This often involves the settlers dispossessing indigenous inhabitants, or instituting legal and other structures which disadvantage them.","['colonization,1.010599970817566,-0.46498000621795654,-1.6998000144958496,-0.20444999635219574,-1.0765000581741333,0.10480000078678131,-0.5059499740600586,0.087227001786232,-0.17021000385284424,-0.025822000578045845,1.0127999782562256,0.5293599963188171,0.5186799764633179,-0.13655999302864075,-0.10508999973535538,-0.21973000466823578,0.5794199705123901,-0.6193299889564514,-0.695580005645752,1.1268999576568604,-0.22889000177383423,-0.7004799842834473,-1.2015000581741333,-0.22867000102996826,0.6980000138282776,-0.31025999784469604,-0.3166300058364868,-1.1233999729156494,0.5097100138664246,0.8556399941444397,1.0872999429702759,-0.9091500043869019,-0.7382699847221375,-0.2935299873352051,-0.9229199886322021,-0.28169000148773193,-0.9150999784469604,-0.23920999467372894,-0.596750020980835,0.5867400169372559,-0.4710899889469147,-0.9479399919509888,0.9776800274848938,0.10079000145196915,0.11114999651908875,-0.0994729995727539,0.5234599709510803,0.04623299837112427,-0.359470009803772,-0.768530011177063']"
8,Agriculture,"Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the twentieth century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output.","['agriculture,-0.4391799867153168,-0.4744099974632263,-0.7864400148391724,0.18403999507427216,-0.11721999943256378,0.0036365000996738672,-1.1830999851226807,-1.2166999578475952,0.5014100074768066,-0.9876300096511841,0.4048199951648712,0.056062001734972,0.9373400211334229,-0.6918100118637085,0.3043600022792816,0.2951200008392334,0.983240008354187,0.33261001110076904,1.014799952507019,0.08775299787521362,0.39699000120162964,-0.8102399706840515,0.03233199939131737,-0.873420000076294,0.6306899785995483,-0.48770999908447266,0.6802600026130676,-0.4487600028514862,-0.3906500041484833,1.1878000497817993,2.9567999839782715,-0.5214899778366089,-0.23215000331401825,-0.2906000018119812,-0.368149995803833,0.2817099988460541,-0.7129499912261963,1.5370999574661255,1.0723999738693237,1.0160000324249268,-1.163699984550476,0.17942999303340912,0.47641000151634216,-0.6381400227546692,0.8478500247001648,0.13288000226020813,-0.885129988193512,0.9532899856567383,0.6621699929237366,0.5673699975013733']"

11,Knowledge,"Knowledge is often understood as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations. Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification: whether it is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified due to a series of thought experiments by Edmund Gettier and have provoked various alternative definitions. Some of them deny that justification is necessary and replace it, for example, with reliability or the manifestation of cognitive virtues. Others contend that justification is needed but formulate additional requirements, for example, that no defeaters of the belief are present or that the person would not have the belief if it was false.","['knowledge,0.4234299957752228,0.5381399989128113,-0.450980007648468,0.04144600033760071,0.9823099970817566,-0.00987400021404028,0.07969000190496445,-0.21400000154972076,0.5142899751663208,0.6114100217819214,0.575160026550293,0.8686800003051758,-0.12535999715328217,-0.7984499931335449,-0.29502999782562256,-0.06264899671077728,0.1739100068807602,0.35187000036239624,0.4566499888896942,0.02356399968266487,0.27702999114990234,0.7101799845695496,0.22700999677181244,-0.2445099949836731,0.8154500126838684,-1.3212000131607056,-0.8735299706459045,-0.8327599763870239,0.32335999608039856,0.0872109979391098,2.9042000770568848,-0.14305000007152557,-0.34808000922203064,-1.6425000429153442,0.07124300301074982,0.40588000416755676,-0.8999099731445312,0.4925599992275238,-0.02595899999141693,0.15602000057697296,0.637220025062561,-0.722100019454956,0.002493100007995963,1.0537999868392944,-0.2852500081062317,-0.29401999711990356,0.3706499934196472,1.1958999633789062,0.18655000627040863,-0.3757399916648865']"

21,Thought,"In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes.","['thought,0.427619993686676,-0.11468999832868576,0.010506000369787216,-0.5466200113296509,0.8905500173568726,0.19262999296188354,-0.6537399888038635,0.08746100217103958,-0.6983000040054321,0.2802000045776367,0.17175999283790588,0.3188599944114685,-0.4625299870967865,-0.1341399997472763,0.6207000017166138,0.3360300064086914,0.4779300093650818,-0.04686100035905838,-0.4517900049686432,-0.3276500105857849,-0.7301700115203857,0.4144900143146515,0.5678300261497498,0.03801000118255615,1.0140000581741333,-1.8849999904632568,-0.9440199732780457,0.06500200182199478,0.5499200224876404,-0.46939000487327576,2.723400115966797,-0.1407099962234497,-0.078015998005867,-0.8142399787902832,-0.0664139986038208,-0.4233599901199341,0.007897799834609032,0.4075799882411957,0.21244999766349792,0.1014999970793724,-0.3720499873161316,0.018199000507593155,-0.08117300271987915,0.7692400217056274,0.3036699891090393,0.051222000271081924,-0.2385600060224533,-0.0345349982380867,-0.04126700013875961,0.25940001010894775']"

24,Logic,"Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It includes both formal and informal logic. Formal logic is the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. It is a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral way. When used as a countable noun, the term ""a logic"" refers to a logical formal system that articulates a proof system. Formal logic contrasts with informal logic, which is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory. While there is no general agreement on how formal and informal logic are to be distinguished, one prominent approach associates their difference with whether the studied arguments are expressed in formal or informal languages. Logic plays a central role in multiple fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.","['logic,-0.25764000415802,-0.3497999906539917,0.03852200135588646,0.5756999850273132,0.3544999957084656,0.42135000228881836,1.5321999788284302,-0.9616699814796448,-1.215399980545044,0.9789100289344788,0.19815999269485474,0.2866800129413605,-0.9308199882507324,0.05401799827814102,-0.5407000184059143,0.9620500206947327,-0.45392999053001404,0.7272099852561951,0.3978300094604492,-0.649940013885498,0.4435400068759918,0.40498000383377075,-0.5575100183486938,0.3444899916648865,0.7264699935913086,-0.7651500105857849,-1.0348999500274658,-0.25582998991012573,0.5835899710655212,0.16553999483585358,1.8835999965667725,-1.2491999864578247,-0.641040027141571,-0.6148899793624878,0.6291300058364868,-0.5901299715042114,-0.08900299668312073,-0.07270699739456177,0.207069993019104,0.396479994058609,0.5862799882888794,-0.642520010471344,-0.3085100054740906,1.5211999416351318,-0.39607998728752136,0.8984799981117249,1.5140999555587769,0.9207199811935425,0.058896999806165695,-0.060674998909235']"

28,Geography,"Geography is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth. The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as a title of a book by Greek scholar Eratosthenes. Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science. One such concept, the first law of geography, proposed by Waldo Tobler, is ""everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.""

37,Education,"Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.","['education,-0.9265999794006348,0.6946700215339661,-0.5907899737358093,-1.0542000532150269,-0.16538000106811523,0.26238998770713806,-0.3778800070285797,-1.4452999830245972,0.4088500142097473,-0.3028799891471863,0.03181999921798706,-0.18016000092029572,0.42866000533103943,-0.8976699709892273,-0.5631600022315979,-0.2702699899673462,0.04569400101900101,0.6257500052452087,1.2644000053405762,0.7622299790382385,0.5526700019836426,0.493010014295578,-0.6045500040054321,0.04439400136470795,0.21021999418735504,-1.4350999593734741,0.3150100111961365,-1.4332000017166138,-1.136299967765808,0.26260000467300415,3.6419999599456787,0.7151299715042114,-0.5168200135231018,-1.3207999467849731,0.011801999993622303,0.35512998700141907,-0.1661600023508072,0.8906700015068054,0.7356799840927124,0.24031999707221985,-0.6390200257301331,-0.3080599904060364,0.09185300022363663,0.3293899893760681,-0.5166000127792358,0.11907999962568283,-0.16218000650405884,0.6071699857711792,0.5168399810791016,0.8316199779510498']"

Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering, but also in other complex fields such as meteorology.","['thermodynamics,-1.5226999521255493,-0.5346900224685669,-1.3207999467849731,0.32886001467704773,-0.7190399765968323,1.2366000413894653,0.9922400116920471,0.1329299956560135,0.32624000310897827,0.4745100140571594,1.3701000213623047,-0.10221000015735626,-0.2271299958229065,0.1922300010919571,-0.4546000063419342,-0.003956200089305639,0.5836499929428101,-0.7978799939155579,-0.16711999475955963,-1.004699945449829,-0.008923199959099293,-0.27028000354766846,-0.6404600143432617,-0.35444000363349915,0.5326899886131287,0.09040900319814682,-0.7839999794960022,-0.35756999254226685,0.7046399712562561,0.3637399971485138,0.5489500164985657,-1.7979999780654907,-0.7248600125312805,-0.8636000156402588,0.45412999391555786,-0.7295899987220764,0.1978600025177002,0.5256100296974182,1.6157000064849854,1.6404999494552612,0.24842000007629395,-0.7515599727630615,1.0591000318527222,0.9002299904823303,-1.176200032234192,0.8428199887275696,1.5119999647140503,0.9318900108337402,0.04680600017309189,-0.3042599856853485']"

54,World,"In its most general sense, the term ""world"" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a ""plurality of worlds"". Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as ""[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be"". Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the ""horizon of all horizons"". In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.","['world,-0.4148600101470947,0.7184799909591675,-0.304500013589859,0.8744500279426575,0.22440999746322632,-0.5648800134658813,-0.3756600022315979,-0.44800999760627747,0.6134700179100037,-0.11359000205993652,0.7455599904060364,-0.10598000138998032,-1.1881999969482422,0.5097399950027466,1.351099967956543,0.06985100358724594,0.7331399917602539,0.2677299976348877,-1.1786999702453613,-0.14800000190734863,0.03985299915075302,0.03310700133442879,-0.2740600109100342,0.2512499988079071,0.4150699973106384,-1.6188000440597534,-0.8177800178527832,-0.7389199733734131,-0.2899700105190277,0.5727699995040894,3.47189998626709,0.7381700277328491,-0.044495001435279846,-0.15118999779224396,-0.9350299835205078,-0.13152000308036804,-0.2856200039386749,0.7632700204849243,-0.8333200216293335,-0.6793000102043152,-0.3909899890422821,-0.6446599960327148,1.0044000148773193,-0.20509999990463257,0.4679900109767914,0.9931399822235107,-0.16221000254154205,-0.46022000908851624,-0.3763900101184845,-0.6754199862480164']"
55,Information,"Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform. At the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed. Any natural process that is not completely random, and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information.

A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.","['health,0.31161001324653625,0.339029997587204,0.03392200171947479,-0.30913999676704407,-0.43077999353408813,0.3416999876499176,-0.6863999962806702,-0.8381699919700623,1.4780000448226929,-0.5249000191688538,0.13325999677181244,-0.06908299773931503,0.4005799889564514,-0.35225000977516174,0.2045300006866455,0.16683000326156616,-0.5697799921035767,-0.13590000569820404,1.1439000368118286,0.15661999583244324,-0.23462000489234924,0.6011099815368652,-0.13867999613285065,-0.37869998812675476,-0.03633999824523926,-1.642899990081787,-0.10716000199317932,-0.7341700196266174,-0.6207699775695801,0.8890299797058105,3.396899938583374,0.885450005531311,-0.2032099962234497,-1.1282999515533447,-0.3681100010871887,0.08820600062608719,0.05552799999713898,0.396589994430542,1.607699990272522,0.031831998378038406,-0.9168400168418884,0.07665999978780746,0.6784800291061401,0.6467199921607971,0.7454900145530701,0.5671499967575073,-1.0097999572753906,0.8105300068855286,0.8594800233840942,1.0404000282287598']"

This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale in slaughterhouses.","['meat,-0.09056500345468521,-1.246500015258789,-1.3551000356674194,-0.6876199841499329,0.9937199950218201,0.8795400261878967,-0.37946999073028564,-0.5007699728012085,1.4837000370025635,-0.1574299931526184,0.2880899906158447,0.14667999744415283,1.7079999446868896,0.4258800148963928,0.8337600231170654,0.587119996547699,0.3613300025463104,0.2549000084400177,-0.2839199900627136,-0.5143200159072876,0.8591200113296509,-1.0503000020980835,1.3135000467300415,0.43799999356269836,-0.37466999888420105,-1.2347999811172485,-0.039021000266075134,0.9260799884796143,1.0478999614715576,-0.5230600237846375,2.2525999546051025,-0.18499000370502472,0.059425000101327896,1.429900050163269,-0.33945000171661377,0.24862000346183777,0.0324149988591671,0.9656999707221985,0.6228700280189514,-0.061792001128196716,0.10780999809503555,0.1703599989414215,0.4497399926185608,0.2661699950695038,1.6015000343322754,1.087499976158142,-0.43432000279426575,0.5092899799346924,-0.2333800047636032,0.3413800001144409']"
63,Year,"A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.","['year,-0.09879299998283386,0.26982998847961426,0.35304000973701477,-0.1072700023651123,-0.015182999894022942,0.053397998213768005,-1.0823999643325806,-0.5300499796867371,0.00954160001128912,0.07042799890041351,-0.08924999833106995,-0.6266599893569946,-0.5266199707984924,-0.5657100081443787,1.8043999671936035,0.016860000789165497,-0.44870999455451965,-0.04145999997854233,-1.1136000156402588,0.1748799979686737,0.49560999870300293,-0.38238000869750977,0.30184999108314514,-0.7067499756813049,-0.3589099943637848,-1.5163999795913696,-0.024403000250458717,-0.5410699844360352,-0.36162999272346497,0.5280299782752991,3.6552999019622803,0.7121400237083435,-0.1699499934911728,0.36368000507354736,0.3398999869823456,-0.4818600118160248,0.10936000198125839,0.6142799854278564,0.15696999430656433,-0.7071599960327148,-1.2359000444412231,-0.014258000068366528,0.09558799862861633,-0.3063400089740753,-0.49740999937057495,-0.04939400032162666,-0.16696999967098236,0.11971999704837799,-0.375110000371933,0.09834799915552139']"

65,Music,"Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions. The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.","['music,-0.9244800209999084,0.5980700254440308,-0.9950000047683716,-0.04529799893498421,-0.38835999369621277,0.03281699866056442,-1.1416000127792358,-0.30202001333236694,-0.3375299870967865,2.049799919128418,0.726140022277832,0.25758999586105347,0.06227799877524376,0.6050500273704529,0.1941400021314621,-0.33840999007225037,0.009858500212430954,0.28398001194000244,-0.02502099983394146,-0.5362300276756287,1.2342000007629395,1.073099970817566,-0.08761800080537796,0.9911400079727173,0.4966599941253662,-0.4660100042819977,-1.7858999967575073,-0.508840024471283,-0.6774399876594543,-0.9162600040435791,3.6684999465942383,-0.5821800231933594,0.7249100208282471,-0.47675999999046326,-0.35207000374794006,0.04123599827289581,0.2728799879550934,-0.20499999821186066,-0.12380000203847885,0.10142000019550323,0.5944899916648865,0.2763800024986267,-0.9274899959564209,-0.6390600204467773,-0.13325999677181244,0.5090199708938599,0.15386000275611877,-0.8654400110244751,-1.3564000129699707,0.28512999415397644']"

69,Data,"In the pursuit of knowledge, data is a collection of discrete values that convey information, describing quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted. A datum is an individual value in a collection of data. Data is usually organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, and which may themselves be used as data in larger structures. Data may be used as variables in a computational process. Data may represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements.

Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation. The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein.

74,Bird,"Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or ""perching"" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.","['bird,0.7867500185966492,0.07936800271272659,-0.76596999168396,0.1931000053882599,0.5501400232315063,0.26493000984191895,-0.7584099769592285,-0.8817999958992004,1.6468000411987305,-0.5438100099563599,0.3351899981498718,0.44398999214172363,1.0889999866485596,0.270440012216568,0.7447100281715393,0.24869999289512634,0.249099999666214,-0.2896600067615509,-1.4556000232696533,0.3560500144958496,-1.1725000143051147,-0.4985800087451935,0.3534500002861023,-0.14180000126361847,0.7173399925231934,-1.1416000127792358,-0.038701001554727554,0.27515000104904175,-0.01770400069653988,-0.44012999534606934,1.9596999883651733,-0.06466600298881531,0.4717699885368347,-0.029999999329447746,-0.31617000699043274,0.2698400020599365,0.5619500279426575,-0.2788200080394745,-0.36357998847961426,-0.21922999620437622,-0.7504600286483765,0.3181700110435486,0.29354000091552734,0.25108999013900757,1.6110999584197998,0.7134000062942505,-0.15242999792099,-0.2536199986934662,0.2641899883747101,0.1587499976158142']"

76,Problem solving,"Problem solving is the process of achieving a goal by overcoming obstacles, a frequent part of most activities. Problems in need of solutions range from simple personal tasks to complex issues in business and technical fields. The former is an example of simple problem solving (SPS) addressing one issue, whereas the latter is complex problem solving (CPS) with multiple interrelated obstacles. Another classification is into well-defined problems with specific obstacles and goals, and ill-defined problems in which the current situation is troublesome but it is not clear what kind of resolution to aim for. Similarly, one may distinguish formal or fact-based problems requiring psychometric intelligence, versus socio-emotional problems which depend on the changeable emotions of individuals or groups, such as tactful behavior, fashion, or gift choices.","['problem solving,0.7506800293922424,0.053126998245716095,0.05462700128555298,0.072503000497818,-0.12020999938249588,0.8271700143814087,0.19641000032424927,-0.3117299973964691,0.36421999335289,-0.33243000507354736,0.2528899908065796,0.3469099998474121,-0.9692100286483765,-0.26155999302864075,0.9512699842453003,0.6160500049591064,0.36542999744415283,0.19097000360488892,0.5557100176811218,-0.48399999737739563,-0.7612500190734863,-0.26583999395370483,-0.2206999957561493,0.33208999037742615,0.7944599986076355,-1.881700038909912,-0.13826000690460205,0.34505000710487366,0.792959988117218,0.4883800148963928,3.2985999584198,0.17404000461101532,-0.0724250003695488,-0.8868100047111511,-0.3127700090408325,0.3091599941253662,-0.32530999183654785,0.10030999779701233,0.6990600228309631,0.22572000324726105,-0.5838500261306763,0.3680500090122223,0.06333599984645844,0.8871600031852722,0.25598999857902527,0.15023000538349152,0.5453900098800659,0.9743599891662598,0.2740100026130676,0.10774999856948853']"

79,Knowledge,"Knowledge is often understood as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may also mean familiarity with objects or situations. Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies in philosophy focus on justification: whether it is needed at all, how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified due to a series of thought experiments by Edmund Gettier and have provoked various alternative definitions. Some of them deny that justification is necessary and replace it, for example, with reliability or the manifestation of cognitive virtues. Others contend that justification is needed but formulate additional requirements, for example, that no defeaters of the belief are present or that the person would not have the belief if it was false.","['knowledge,0.4234299957752228,0.5381399989128113,-0.450980007648468,0.04144600033760071,0.9823099970817566,-0.00987400021404028,0.07969000190496445,-0.21400000154972076,0.5142899751663208,0.6114100217819214,0.575160026550293,0.8686800003051758,-0.12535999715328217,-0.7984499931335449,-0.29502999782562256,-0.06264899671077728,0.1739100068807602,0.35187000036239624,0.4566499888896942,0.02356399968266487,0.27702999114990234,0.7101799845695496,0.22700999677181244,-0.2445099949836731,0.8154500126838684,-1.3212000131607056,-0.8735299706459045,-0.8327599763870239,0.32335999608039856,0.0872109979391098,2.9042000770568848,-0.14305000007152557,-0.34808000922203064,-1.6425000429153442,0.07124300301074982,0.40588000416755676,-0.8999099731445312,0.4925599992275238,-0.02595899999141693,0.15602000057697296,0.637220025062561,-0.722100019454956,0.002493100007995963,1.0537999868392944,-0.2852500081062317,-0.29401999711990356,0.3706499934196472,1.1958999633789062,0.18655000627040863,-0.3757399916648865']"

91,Idea,"In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are the results of thought. Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation.","['idea,0.4756399989128113,-0.016435999423265457,-0.4047600030899048,-0.5365200042724609,0.31659001111984253,0.4743100106716156,-0.6732800006866455,-0.656719982624054,-0.6571900248527527,0.6108499765396118,-0.21261000633239746,0.5158299803733826,-0.31929999589920044,0.2422100007534027,0.35774001479148865,0.4647200107574463,0.5480899810791016,0.0816269963979721,0.3618699908256531,-0.4078199863433838,0.18410000205039978,0.39489999413490295,-0.2528400123119354,-0.002878400031477213,0.8028200268745422,-1.819200038909912,-0.7143800258636475,0.20724999904632568,0.6100800037384033,-0.34518998861312866,2.7284998893737793,-0.09092800319194794,-0.9175999760627747,-0.6987699866294861,-0.4949199855327606,-0.6096000075340271,-0.23784999549388885,0.3492099940776825,-0.48600998520851135,-0.15449999272823334,-0.10588999837636948,-0.3141799867153168,-0.25804999470710754,0.38646000623703003,-0.024248000234365463,0.05179499834775925,-0.2581599950790405,0.3867200016975403,-0.08966799825429916,0.3657200038433075']"

107,Language,"Language is a structured system of communication that consists of grammar and vocabulary. It is the primary means by which humans convey meaning, both in spoken and written forms, and may also be conveyed through sign languages. The vast majority of human languages have developed writing systems that allow for the recording and preservation of the sounds or signs of language. Human language is characterized by its cultural and historical diversity, with significant variations observed between cultures and across time. Human languages possess the properties of productivity and displacement, which enable the creation of an infinite number of sentences, and the ability to refer to objects, events, and ideas that are not immediately present in the discourse. The use of human language relies on social convention and is acquired through learning.","['language,-0.5799000263214111,-0.11010000109672546,-1.1556999683380127,-0.0029905999545007944,-0.2061299979686737,0.452890008687973,-0.1667100042104721,-1.0382000207901,-0.9924100041389465,0.3988400101661682,0.5922999978065491,0.22990000247955322,1.521299958229065,-0.17764000594615936,-0.29725998640060425,-0.3923499882221222,-0.7847099900245667,0.1559399962425232,0.6907699704170227,0.5953699946403503,-0.44339999556541443,0.5351399779319763,0.3285300135612488,1.2437000274658203,1.2971999645233154,-1.3877999782562256,-1.0924999713897705,-0.4092499911785126,-0.5697100162506104,-0.346560001373291,3.7163000106811523,-1.0489000082015991,-0.4670799970626831,-0.44738999009132385,0.00622999994084239,0.019649000838398933,-0.40160998702049255,-0.6291300058364868,-0.8250600099563599,0.45590999722480774,0.826259970664978,0.5709099769592285,0.21198999881744385,0.4686500132083893,-0.6002699732780457,0.29919999837875366,0.6794400215148926,1.423799991607666,-0.032152000814676285,-0.12602999806404114']"

Policies used in subjective decision-making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result, are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work–life balance policy... Moreover, Governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentives and voluntary practices.

123,Thought,"In their most common sense, the terms thought and thinking refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes.

Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to the light.","['camera,0.5499399900436401,-0.09765200316905975,1.417799949645996,-0.11266999691724777,0.4429300129413605,-0.11298000067472458,0.03150000050663948,-0.8057699799537659,-0.023163000121712685,0.4078899919986725,0.45103999972343445,-0.33059999346733093,-0.22870999574661255,1.3476999998092651,-0.21299000084400177,0.3502199947834015,-1.12090003490448,0.48034998774528503,-0.8444799780845642,-1.2127000093460083,0.9107599854469299,1.1684999465942383,-0.26330000162124634,0.1994899958372116,0.6137999892234802,-1.249400019645691,-0.8848000168800354,0.71670001745224,0.20408999919891357,-0.9587500095367432,1.9943000078201294,0.09310899674892426,0.12578000128269196,-1.0879000425338745,-0.2846600115299225,0.5615299940109253,0.49222999811172485,0.3917999863624573,-0.6065700054168701,-0.8817700147628784,1.444700002670288,0.8809000253677368,-0.10175999999046326,-0.003186899935826659,-0.279339998960495,-0.8291599750518799,1.170799970626831,-0.8004000186920166,-0.017230000346899033,0.1501300036907196']"

132,Paper,"Paper is a thin sheet material produced by mechanically or chemically processing cellulose fibres derived from wood, rags, grasses or other vegetable sources in water, draining the water through fine mesh leaving the fibre evenly distributed on the surface, followed by pressing and drying. Although paper was originally made in single sheets by hand, almost all is now made on large machines—some making reels 10 metres wide, running at 2,000 metres per minute and up to 600,000 tonnes a year. It is a versatile material with many uses, including printing, painting, graphics, signage, design, packaging, decorating, writing, and cleaning. It may also be used as filter paper, wallpaper, book endpaper, conservation paper, laminated worktops, toilet tissue, or currency and security paper, or in a number of industrial and construction processes.","['paper,-0.7121599912643433,0.028648000210523605,0.14847999811172485,-0.23792999982833862,0.25071999430656433,0.3365600109100342,-0.9905999898910522,-1.1897000074386597,-0.024258999153971672,-0.4192599952220917,-0.09020200371742249,0.16064000129699707,0.1693599969148636,-0.023698000237345695,0.3124600052833557,-0.013671999797224998,-0.8050600290298462,-0.227960005402565,0.3249500095844269,-0.7811999917030334,1.242799997329712,-0.2721799910068512,0.9178400039672852,-0.6788600087165833,-0.10610999912023544,-1.2105000019073486,-1.02839994430542,0.965939998626709,0.25268998742103577,-0.49445998668670654,2.836199998855591,-0.9285500049591064,-0.12636999785900116,0.15115000307559967,-1.1246999502182007,0.16181999444961548,-0.01959799975156784,0.8214499950408936,0.47804999351501465,-0.19526000320911407,1.2688000202178955,-0.3549000024795532,0.1558700054883957,0.040564000606536865,0.32875001430511475,0.09111499786376953,-0.3478499948978424,0.5934000015258789,0.45267000794410706,-0.610260009765625']"

Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. More rarely, a trade association or government agency advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food, food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.","['marketing,0.0042667998932302,-0.4078499972820282,-0.2287299931049347,0.8150500059127808,-0.286190003156662,-0.011145000346004963,-1.1461999416351318,-1.5706000328063965,0.9287899732589722,0.4456000030040741,0.06643400341272354,0.7335900068283081,-0.7748000025749207,-0.44802001118659973,-0.13771000504493713,-0.2730500102043152,0.07932300120592117,0.8604000210762024,0.20333999395370483,-0.6603299975395203,1.0420000553131104,-0.13168999552726746,-0.32725000381469727,-0.0005730700213462114,-0.8458600044250488,-1.1466000080108643,-0.5760200023651123,-0.5364800095558167,0.1797800064086914,-0.11146000027656555,2.5425000190734863,0.6139000058174133,-0.03535600006580353,-0.5539299845695496,-0.3551799952983856,-0.05069600045681,-1.2372000217437744,0.6711599826812744,0.058278001844882965,-0.29587000608444214,0.38005998730659485,0.07300499826669693,-0.5756700038909912,0.2546199858188629,0.3716900050640106,-0.40206998586654663,-0.09340400248765945,0.8910700082778931,-0.020562000572681427,1.3746000528335571']"

150,Marriage,"Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a culturally and often legally recognized union between people called spouses. It establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. It is nearly a cultural universal, but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time. Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. A marriage ceremony is called a wedding.","['marriage,0.331059992313385,0.7070800065994263,-1.409999966621399,-0.34871000051498413,0.5093700289726257,2.2802000045776367,-0.4165399968624115,0.2368299961090088,-0.24869999289512634,0.21143999695777893,-0.21932999789714813,0.4025300145149231,-0.05639300122857094,-0.29131999611854553,0.9670400023460388,0.24966000020503998,-0.8640400171279907,-1.3314000368118286,1.1777000427246094,0.41648998856544495,0.317220002412796,0.6089900135993958,-0.559939980506897,0.43292000889778137,0.32047000527381897,-1.7058000564575195,-0.24605000019073486,-1.0844999551773071,0.49689000844955444,0.3077999949455261,2.0297000408172607,0.08260499686002731,-0.9063599705696106,-0.27566999197006226,0.036343999207019806,-0.9068400263786316,-0.03457900136709213,-0.08998200297355652,-0.39465999603271484,-0.2991099953651428,-0.6047400236129761,-0.22062000632286072,-0.20685000717639923,0.7343400120735168,-0.7429500222206116,-0.22585999965667725,-0.3781200051307678,-1.3823000192642212,0.10909999907016754,0.3492099940776825']"

152,Combination,"In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter. For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange. More formally, a k-combination of a set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S. So, two combinations are identical if and only if each combination has the same members. If the set has n elements, the number of k-combinations, denoted by  or , is equal to the binomial coefficient","['combination,0.37185999751091003,-0.0034791999496519566,-0.5592700242996216,0.23785999417304993,-0.22040000557899475,1.0085999965667725,0.29973000288009644,-0.3056899905204773,0.23800000548362732,1.0393999814987183,0.3794800043106079,0.17156000435352325,-0.10187999904155731,-0.04087400063872337,-0.5129200220108032,0.1198199987411499,0.0720909982919693,0.10010000318288803,-0.49830999970436096,-1.0116000175476074,-0.3227100074291229,-0.318230003118515,-0.15166999399662018,-0.05092800036072731,-0.3180199861526489,-0.9318900108337402,-0.7789000272750854,0.0948989987373352,0.6370800137519836,0.25231000781059265,2.884399890899658,0.13321000337600708,0.258899986743927,-0.03991499915719032,0.7896699905395508,0.0171470008790493,-0.13040000200271606,0.6868399977684021,0.05678299814462662,-0.44690001010894775,0.3371399939060211,0.27628999948501587,-0.13586999475955963,0.5579100251197815,0.38517001271247864,0.3267099857330322,0.5496699810028076,0.3390899896621704,-0.08132900297641754,0.5034099817276001']"

158,Communication,"Communication is usually defined as the transmission of information. The term can also refer to the message itself or the field of inquiry studying these transmissions, also known as communication studies. There are some disagreements about the precise definition of communication, for example, whether unintentional or failed transmissions are also included and whether communication does not just transmit meaning but also create it. Models of communication aim to provide a simplified overview of its main components and their interaction. Many models include the idea that a source uses a coding system to express information in the form of a message. The source uses a channel to send the message to a receiver who has to decode it in order to understand its meaning. Channels are usually discussed in terms of the senses used to perceive the message, like hearing, sight, smell, touch, and taste.","['communication,0.2732200026512146,0.354559987783432,0.3192799985408783,0.9018800258636475,-0.23847000300884247,-0.07024600356817245,0.11191000044345856,-0.6382499933242798,0.508650004863739,-0.21017000079154968,0.8837299942970276,0.45405998826026917,-0.1618099957704544,0.0015502000460401177,-1.3919999599456787,0.03620000183582306,-0.8448899984359741,0.3130800127983093,0.5156099796295166,0.01126100029796362,0.7261999845504761,0.9095600247383118,-0.33162999153137207,0.13868999481201172,0.9426599740982056,-0.6363999843597412,0.46382999420166016,-0.9221400022506714,0.4527699947357178,0.28801000118255615,3.1851000785827637,0.18559999763965607,-0.10610999912023544,-1.42739999294281,-0.5153399705886841,0.3799700140953064,-0.41655999422073364,0.23597000539302826,-0.13083000481128693,1.0455000400543213,1.011299967765808,-0.237869992852211,0.04547400027513504,0.5690400004386902,-0.1127299964427948,-0.17096999287605286,0.46709001064300537,0.7039899826049805,0.08945400267839432,0.3854700028896332']"

166,Role,"A role is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position. It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society. Social role theory posits the following about social behavior:The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles.
Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society.
Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors.
When individuals approve of a social role, they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms.
Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change.
The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.","['role,0.45037999749183655,0.36695998907089233,-0.9514399766921997,-0.21527999639511108,0.6360300183296204,0.9909800291061401,0.2028300017118454,-0.05123100057244301,0.0913110002875328,0.06803499907255173,0.23985999822616577,0.9972500205039978,-0.9640300273895264,0.476500004529953,0.0070350999012589455,-0.2690500020980835,0.46779999136924744,0.15972000360488892,0.2699599862098694,0.35076001286506653,0.1868000030517578,0.3894599974155426,-0.13933999836444855,0.039942000061273575,-0.08668699860572815,-1.8629000186920166,-0.3436200022697449,-0.47242000699043274,-0.18645000457763672,0.39890000224113464,2.9512999057769775,0.22005000710487366,-0.0449879989027977,-1.3839999437332153,0.11196000128984451,0.40053999423980713,-0.39739999175071716,0.008740900084376335,-0.9785199761390686,-0.6157600283622742,-0.67153000831604,0.5019599795341492,-0.4969800114631653,-0.9747599959373474,-0.25442999601364136,-0.19439999759197235,-0.18629999458789825,-0.13440999388694763,-0.30171999335289,0.7542600035667419']"

Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a success, another might consider to be a failure, a qualified success or a neutral situation. For example, a film that is a commercial failure or even a box-office bomb can go on to receive a cult following, with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness.","['success,-0.09364999830722809,0.5235900282859802,-0.2577100098133087,-0.07059399783611298,-0.02470399998128414,0.1547199934720993,-0.7163800001144409,0.1992100030183792,0.3733699917793274,1.0700000524520874,0.18651999533176422,0.1488499939441681,-0.9090399742126465,-0.2983900010585785,0.260019987821579,-0.15729999542236328,0.6276900172233582,-0.054287999868392944,-0.45903998613357544,-0.11208000034093857,-0.038780998438596725,-0.013489999808371067,-0.029441000893712044,-0.29287999868392944,0.4866499900817871,-1.1698999404907227,-1.2364000082015991,-0.5030900239944458,0.2826099991798401,0.3625499904155731,3.053499937057495,0.755649983882904,0.05812399834394455,-0.6126999855041504,0.11772999912500381,-0.2469400018453598,-0.22846999764442444,0.5884900093078613,-0.7802199721336365,-0.9557200074195862,-0.4678399860858917,-0.5412399768829346,-0.6744300127029419,-0.507889986038208,-0.29919999837875366,0.034926000982522964,-0.2108599990606308,0.28679001331329346,-0.09946099668741226,0.1603900045156479']"

173,Education,"Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.","['education,-0.9265999794006348,0.6946700215339661,-0.5907899737358093,-1.0542000532150269,-0.16538000106811523,0.26238998770713806,-0.3778800070285797,-1.4452999830245972,0.4088500142097473,-0.3028799891471863,0.03181999921798706,-0.18016000092029572,0.42866000533103943,-0.8976699709892273,-0.5631600022315979,-0.2702699899673462,0.04569400101900101,0.6257500052452087,1.2644000053405762,0.7622299790382385,0.5526700019836426,0.493010014295578,-0.6045500040054321,0.04439400136470795,0.21021999418735504,-1.4350999593734741,0.3150100111961365,-1.4332000017166138,-1.136299967765808,0.26260000467300415,3.6419999599456787,0.7151299715042114,-0.5168200135231018,-1.3207999467849731,0.011801999993622303,0.35512998700141907,-0.1661600023508072,0.8906700015068054,0.7356799840927124,0.24031999707221985,-0.6390200257301331,-0.3080599904060364,0.09185300022363663,0.3293899893760681,-0.5166000127792358,0.11907999962568283,-0.16218000650405884,0.6071699857711792,0.5168399810791016,0.8316199779510498']"

178,Attention,"Attention in psychology, is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of other stimuli. A process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether considered subjective or objective. William James (1890) wrote that ""Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence."" Attention has also been described as the allocation of limited cognitive processing resources. Attention is manifested by an attentional bottleneck, in terms of the amount of data the brain can process each second; for example, in human vision, only less than 1% of the visual input data can enter the bottleneck, leading to inattentional blindness.","['attention,-0.08423800021409988,0.5305299758911133,0.1281599998474121,-0.2888599932193756,-0.18125000596046448,-0.20499999821186066,-0.09697599709033966,0.07047399878501892,0.23336000740528107,0.14648999273777008,-0.5529299974441528,-0.02288700081408024,-0.3571400046348572,-0.3533799946308136,0.6115800142288208,-0.21432000398635864,-0.024156000465154648,-0.49678999185562134,0.04491699859499931,-0.5581799745559692,0.3216699957847595,0.5680800080299377,0.18366999924182892,-0.0069877998903393745,0.7587000131607056,-1.6714999675750732,-0.6159600019454956,-0.35291001200675964,0.11358000338077545,0.5399699807167053,2.8148000240325928,0.8508800268173218,0.12374000251293182,-1.0855000019073486,-0.4970499873161316,0.3544299900531769,-0.4323599934577942,-0.1809999942779541,-0.3766799867153168,-0.5806300044059753,0.28077998757362366,0.6333900094032288,-0.04603800177574158,-0.09143699705600739,0.5966299772262573,0.06654699891805649,0.06263799965381622,0.5008999705314636,0.2366199940443039,0.16071000695228577']"

184,Wood,"Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an organic material – a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber.","['wood,-0.6155400276184082,0.4727500081062317,-0.2800999879837036,-0.13931000232696533,0.7078999876976013,0.6626999974250793,-0.9928200244903564,-0.8956000208854675,-0.05798399820923805,-0.9001399874687195,-0.2795099914073944,0.8359500169754028,0.1703599989414215,-0.18788999319076538,-0.045566000044345856,0.5882999897003174,1.0997999906539917,0.10762999951839447,-0.1315000057220459,-1.4728000164031982,0.34299999475479126,-0.22096000611782074,0.05104599893093109,-0.8368899822235107,0.034526001662015915,-0.2888000011444092,0.15191000699996948,0.7243499755859375,0.35008999705314636,-0.4701699912548065,2.200900077819824,-1.6024999618530273,0.45587998628616333,-0.02505899965763092,0.3679400086402893,0.7784600257873535,0.5296300053596497,0.5188800096511841,0.8937000036239624,-0.21038000285625458,0.20181000232696533,-0.03696800023317337,0.17278000712394714,-0.14720000326633453,1.1476999521255493,0.741100013256073,-0.24372999370098114,-1.3033000230789185,-0.1985500007867813,-0.39879000186920166']"

The word ""office"" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it ; the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an adjective, the term ""office"" may refer to business-related tasks. In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair. An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size, through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.

193,Cigarette,"A cigarette is a narrow cylinder containing a combustible material, typically tobacco, that is rolled into thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end, causing it to smolder; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end. Cigarette smoking is the most common method of tobacco consumption. The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but the word is sometimes used to refer to other substances, such as a cannabis cigarette or an herbal cigarette. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is typically white.","['cigarette,-0.6075500249862671,-1.035099983215332,0.2517000138759613,-0.23286999762058258,-0.14504000544548035,1.0845999717712402,0.13589000701904297,-0.8606100082397461,1.9077999591827393,0.7862300276756287,-0.19467000663280487,-0.23169000446796417,0.0014676999999210238,-0.4048500061035156,0.5107499957084656,0.2830600142478943,-0.6511200070381165,0.2763800024986267,-0.17473000288009644,-1.8468999862670898,1.3486000299453735,-0.21860000491142273,0.37553998827934265,0.08958300203084946,-1.0951999425888062,-2.0327000617980957,-0.21629999577999115,0.8149799704551697,0.6879400014877319,-0.1888599991798401,0.9312199950218201,0.3048099875450134,0.09806299954652786,0.6589099764823914,-0.33772000670433044,-0.8236200213432312,-0.05574199929833412,0.02942200005054474,0.22232000529766083,-0.24552999436855316,0.46869000792503357,0.4308199882507324,0.2995699942111969,0.9158499836921692,1.0240999460220337,0.2438099980354309,-0.9610599875450134,-0.6724600195884705,0.2324800044298172,-0.671239972114563']"

211,Telephone,"A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε and φωνή, together meaning distant voice. A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use early in the telephone's history.","['telephone,0.6885899901390076,0.06982400268316269,1.2726999521255493,1.2747000455856323,-0.1518000066280365,-0.4036099910736084,-0.9646300077438354,0.43764999508857727,-0.1251000016927719,-0.4985100030899048,-0.12483999878168106,-0.19960999488830566,0.239889994263649,0.03270399942994118,-0.0649539977312088,0.14312000572681427,-1.8085999488830566,-0.23910999298095703,0.6355199813842773,-0.5222399830818176,1.2467999458312988,0.552619993686676,0.02412099950015545,0.6577900052070618,0.36076000332832336,-1.4249000549316406,0.4103100001811981,-0.2779400050640106,0.05844299867749214,-0.2640500068664551,2.8197999000549316,-0.10006000101566315,-0.05415700003504753,0.042243000119924545,-0.030527999624609947,-0.4184199869632721,-0.06100799888372421,-0.18118999898433685,-0.03531600162386894,0.8185799717903137,1.0605000257492065,0.863349974155426,-0.16978000104427338,0.5049800276756287,-0.12317000329494476,-0.22187000513076782,-0.3973099887371063,0.5404000282287598,0.062449999153614044,0.0742259994149208']"

215,Concept,"Concepts are defined as abstract ideas. They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of the concept behind principles, thoughts and beliefs.
They play an important role in all aspects of cognition. As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science.","['concept,0.39570000767707825,0.2117599993944168,-0.5469499826431274,-0.22551000118255615,0.54093998670578,0.6112599968910217,-0.2902199923992157,-1.5670000314712524,-0.19426000118255615,0.6862300038337708,0.5310800075531006,0.4525200128555298,-0.7637199759483337,0.1854500025510788,-0.24270999431610107,0.3519099950790405,0.17558999359607697,0.6811100244522095,0.20106999576091766,-0.4118799865245819,0.05629400163888931,-0.023389000445604324,-0.9090099930763245,0.27689000964164734,0.6848400235176086,-0.9519299864768982,-1.4226000308990479,0.006109499838203192,0.49919000267982483,0.18655000627040863,2.617000102996826,-0.636929988861084,-0.7306699752807617,-0.836430013179779,-0.11142999678850174,-0.505299985408783,-0.005398300010710955,0.14911000430583954,-0.8979200124740601,0.10544999688863754,0.052163999527692795,-0.9660099744796753,-0.24090999364852905,0.20231999456882477,-0.36072999238967896,0.18540999293327332,0.42048999667167664,0.21895000338554382,0.20162999629974365,0.3357599973678589']"

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. The opposite of inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index. As prices faced by households do not all increase at the same rate, the consumer price index (CPI) is often used for this purpose.

228,Importance,"Importance is a property of entities that matter or make a difference. For example, World War II was an important event and Albert Einstein was an important person because of how they affected the world. There are disagreements in the academic literature about what type of difference is required. According to the causal impact view, something is important if it has a big causal impact on the world. This view is rejected by various theorists, who insist that an additional aspect is required: that the impact in question makes a value difference. This is often understood in terms of how the important thing affects the well-being of people. So on this view, World War II was important, not just because it brought about many wide-ranging changes but because these changes had severe negative impacts on the well-being of the people involved. The difference in question is usually understood counterfactually as the contrast between how the world actually is and how the world would have been without the existence of the important entity. It is often argued that importance claims are context- or domain-dependent. This means that they either explicitly or implicitly assume a certain domain in relation to which something matters. For example, studying for an exam is important in the context of academic success but not in the context of world history. Importance comes in degrees: to be important usually means to matter more within the domain in question than most of the other entities within this domain.","['importance,0.24118000268936157,0.9970999956130981,-0.9992799758911133,-0.06330999732017517,0.9684799909591675,-0.18693000078201294,0.3705199956893921,-0.23204000294208527,0.4949199855327606,-0.15101000666618347,0.34286001324653625,0.38078001141548157,-0.08031599968671799,-0.8257399797439575,-0.5569999814033508,0.3953700065612793,0.2918199896812439,-0.2956700026988983,0.7907800078392029,0.03327000141143799,0.08356600254774094,-0.12279000133275986,-0.29517999291419983,-0.7887200117111206,1.0299999713897705,-1.2660000324249268,-0.6873300075531006,-0.09498400241136551,0.165460005402565,0.36656999588012695,2.7427000999450684,0.8413400053977966,0.17775000631809235,-1.4742000102996826,-0.3259600102901459,-0.34393998980522156,-0.6703000068664551,0.6058400273323059,-1.0551999807357788,0.45974001288414,-0.4463199973106384,-0.6126499772071838,-0.0025146000552922487,-0.31066998839378357,-0.1607999950647354,0.445499986410141,-0.2771100103855133,1.0094000101089478,0.053821999579668045,-0.1435299962759018']"

243,Grandparent,"Grandparents, individually known as grandmother and grandfather, are the parents of a person's father or mother – paternal or maternal. Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, sixty-four genetic great-great-great-great grandparents, etc. In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased. It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.","['grandparent,0.6402599811553955,0.579010009765625,-0.227060005068779,-0.7700700163841248,1.7289999723434448,0.8601300120353699,-0.29385998845100403,0.2534100115299225,0.24121999740600586,0.38071000576019287,0.6232900023460388,0.2875500023365021,1.0636999607086182,0.8154399991035461,0.39827999472618103,0.6161400079727173,-0.683430016040802,-0.14478999376296997,0.9945999979972839,0.9865300059318542,-0.4683400094509125,0.5154399871826172,-1.0521999597549438,1.2160999774932861,0.25137001276016235,-0.13839000463485718,-0.42282000184059143,-1.017899990081787,0.7091299891471863,0.389629989862442,-0.5033400058746338,0.8004900217056274,-0.16357000172138214,0.7378799915313721,0.1904900074005127,-0.30748000741004944,-0.16117000579833984,-0.48247000575065613,0.563510000705719,-0.09164699912071228,0.1029599979519844,-0.42730000615119934,-0.06385699659585953,1.6009000539779663,-0.4077399969100952,0.13157999515533447,-0.02114100009202957,-0.0885469987988472,-0.21371999382972717,0.3405799865722656']"

246,Photograph,"A photograph is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip.

The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.","['photograph,-0.05618499964475632,1.0160000324249268,0.4114600121974945,-0.3913100063800812,0.9198600053787231,-0.017666000872850418,-1.0757999420166016,-0.6164600253105164,0.29690998792648315,-0.2931100130081177,-0.05523199960589409,-0.15626999735832214,0.18752999603748322,0.6534900069236755,0.5967199802398682,-0.2364799976348877,-1.1749000549316406,-0.6941499710083008,-0.2496200054883957,-0.32958000898361206,0.25672999024391174,0.6438199877738953,0.16288000345230103,-0.3623799979686737,0.41527000069618225,-1.113700032234192,-1.3141000270843506,0.8557599782943726,0.2621400058269501,-0.5308399796485901,0.8670600056648254,-0.7618899941444397,-0.3523400127887726,-1.180799961090088,-0.5215399861335754,0.7844399809837341,0.5795199871063232,0.0995590016245842,-1.003000020980835,-0.6442899703979492,1.0144000053405762,0.2879300117492676,-0.04956899955868721,-0.2948000133037567,0.2798199951648712,-0.7367299795150757,0.10894999653100967,-0.7937099933624268,0.30583998560905457,-0.7108500003814697']"

252,Imagination,"Imagination is the production or simulation of novel objects, sensations, and ideas in the mind without any immediate input of the senses. Stefan Szczelkun characterises it as the forming of experiences in one's mind, which can be re-creations of past experiences, such as vivid memories with imagined changes, or completely invented and possibly fantastic scenes. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process.

255,Resource,"Resource refers to all the materials available in our environment which are technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally sustainable and help us to satisfy our needs and wants. Resources can broadly be classified upon their availability — they are classified into renewable and non-renewable resources. They can also be classified as actual and potential on the basis of the level of development and use, on the basis of origin they can be classified as biotic and abiotic, and on the basis of their distribution, as ubiquitous and localised. An item becomes a resource with time and developing technology. The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well-being. From a human perspective, a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective, a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism.","['resource,-0.3174999952316284,0.10283000022172928,0.22891999781131744,0.8347200155258179,0.6952499747276306,-0.5359299778938293,-0.3580999970436096,-0.6521400213241577,1.711899995803833,0.21145999431610107,0.4501799941062927,0.6136999726295471,1.0888999700546265,-0.32749998569488525,-0.6065499782562256,0.11269000172615051,1.055400013923645,0.3986400067806244,0.745419979095459,-0.1270499974489212,0.42322999238967896,-0.13154000043869019,-0.5328599810600281,-0.2612600028514862,0.29638001322746277,-0.12541000545024872,-0.12088000029325485,-0.8795899748802185,0.39937999844551086,0.8820199966430664,2.892400026321411,-0.5273699760437012,0.24831999838352203,-1.070199966430664,0.0018763999687507749,0.9444400072097778,-0.9451199769973755,-0.21191999316215515,0.8386200070381165,-0.05916300043463707,-0.01418600045144558,-0.4212599992752075,-0.03341799974441528,0.7332800030708313,-0.42879998683929443,0.13330000638961792,-0.03857000172138214,1.0715999603271484,0.5529999732971191,0.23829999566078186']"

272,Personality,"Personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that are formed from biological and environmental factors, and which change over time. While there is no generally agreed-upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with the environment one is surrounded by. Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as traits that predict an individual's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.","['personality,-0.07822199910879135,0.9442399740219116,-0.5832700133323669,0.5740000009536743,0.5916799902915955,1.1541999578475952,0.2669900059700012,-0.3683600127696991,-0.7649499773979187,0.8358299732208252,0.384660005569458,0.16264000535011292,-0.10452000051736832,0.6347200274467468,-0.11130999773740768,0.17773999273777008,-0.46768999099731445,0.5537899732589722,0.052636999636888504,-0.09654700011014938,-1.0085999965667725,1.1473000049591064,0.16640999913215637,0.37834998965263367,0.6032900214195251,-0.9851199984550476,-0.9450600147247314,0.16035999357700348,0.4345700144767761,1.1132999658584595,2.05049991607666,0.014121999964118004,0.4266200065612793,-1.698199987411499,-0.07143600285053253,0.5336300134658813,-0.4576700031757355,0.5016700029373169,-0.5666900277137756,-0.6795200109481812,0.2604300081729889,0.4705899953842163,-1.1582000255584717,0.672730028629303,0.32690000534057617,-0.1066100001335144,-0.03191100060939789,0.0047705997712910175,0.1070299968123436,1.1139999628067017']"
273,Psychology,"Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As social scientists, psychologists aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups. Ψ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived, is commonly associated with the science.","['psychology,-0.9694899916648865,0.9375600218772888,-0.9681500196456909,-0.6330699920654297,-0.08172599971294403,0.5635200142860413,0.12967999279499054,-1.0083999633789062,-0.13071000576019287,0.34125998616218567,0.5135999917984009,0.08798400312662125,-0.4378400146961212,0.08101200312376022,-0.5806400179862976,-0.28723999857902527,-0.3262600004673004,0.3557699918746948,-0.016915999352931976,0.8293300271034241,0.2827500104904175,0.9533600211143494,0.27083998918533325,0.27340999245643616,0.4944399893283844,-1.0657000541687012,-0.9966899752616882,-0.954069972038269,-0.579289972782135,0.5410299897193909,1.722499966621399,-0.5428100228309631,-0.025387000292539597,-2.1854000091552734,-0.3912400007247925,-0.2200700044631958,-1.0152000188827515,0.6482999920845032,1.623900055885315,0.6058099865913391,-0.06402499973773956,-0.6805999875068665,-0.02143000066280365,1.1568000316619873,0.17143000662326813,-0.03212299942970276,1.6881999969482422,0.8903099894523621,-0.09762100130319595,0.8614699840545654']"

293,Currency,"A currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins.
A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state. Under this definition, the British Pound Sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance; i.e., legal tender laws may require a particular unit of account for payments to government agencies.","['currency,-0.5354999899864197,-0.5153399705886841,0.5695099830627441,-0.4161800146102905,0.3257000148296356,-1.0463000535964966,0.5098999738693237,-0.5923399925231934,-1.0413000583648682,0.36789000034332275,0.8016200065612793,1.361799955368042,-0.35554999113082886,0.2734000086784363,0.6804100275039673,1.1134999990463257,0.501230001449585,-1.0570000410079956,-0.2116200029850006,0.08211199939250946,1.306399941444397,-1.332200050354004,-0.43404000997543335,-0.6573899984359741,-0.4227199852466583,-1.1984000205993652,0.7186300158500671,0.0797870010137558,0.13420000672340393,1.1145000457763672,3.0025999546051025,0.008155199699103832,1.4247000217437744,0.637719988822937,-0.6129500269889832,-0.5245500206947327,-0.8812599778175354,-0.6355400085449219,-0.48973000049591064,-1.051200032234192,-0.26916998624801636,0.37163999676704407,1.279099941253662,-0.20186999440193176,-0.18133999407291412,-0.7628600001335144,0.17423999309539795,0.9559199810028076,0.5303800106048584,-0.597100019454956']"
294,Employment,"Employment is a relationship between two parties regulating the provision of paid labour services. Usually based on a contract, one party, the employer, which might be a corporation, a not-for-profit organization, a co-operative, or any other entity, pays the other, the employee, in return for carrying out assigned work. Employees work in return for wages, which can be paid on the basis of an hourly rate, by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does, the prevailing conditions of the sector and the bargaining power between the parties. Employees in some sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payments or stock options. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits may include health insurance, housing, disability insurance. Employment is typically governed by employment laws, organisation or legal contracts.","['employment,-0.7326800227165222,-0.1681399941444397,-0.02139200083911419,-0.4470300078392029,0.43612000346183777,0.06293600052595139,-0.849590003490448,-0.3746899962425232,0.48221999406814575,-0.5018399953842163,0.4878099858760834,-0.5911999940872192,0.4283300042152405,-0.8329399824142456,0.7742400169372559,-0.028963999822735786,-0.22436000406742096,-0.476639986038208,1.2367000579833984,-0.531440019607544,0.7497100234031677,-0.09384600073099136,-0.8879799842834473,-0.1867700070142746,-0.219760000705719,-0.27755001187324524,0.31696999073028564,-0.7099400162696838,0.36289000511169434,1.3279999494552612,2.952699899673462,0.24720999598503113,0.3049499988555908,-1.1679999828338623,-0.16540999710559845,-0.21279999613761902,-0.42572999000549316,0.00865320023149252,0.3659000098705292,-0.5244100093841553,-0.9309599995613098,-0.7534499764442444,0.5497900247573853,-0.008331299759447575,-0.10103999823331833,-1.26010000705719,-0.04471899941563606,0.7967299818992615,0.5866900086402893,0.9515399932861328']"

The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology.","['virus,2.091599941253662,-1.3335000276565552,0.5613899827003479,0.09867700189352036,-0.16551999747753143,0.7775700092315674,0.09293100237846375,-1.01010000705719,1.9818999767303467,0.627590000629425,1.3451000452041626,-0.13846999406814575,0.5238699913024902,-0.2609100043773651,0.9318100214004517,0.2732900083065033,-1.045699954032898,-0.2994999885559082,-0.7625399827957153,1.0306999683380127,-1.8733999729156494,-0.6287000179290771,1.3596999645233154,0.798039972782135,1.0401999950408936,-1.5094000101089478,0.17656999826431274,0.06907399743795395,0.29997000098228455,-0.1362999975681305,2.118000030517578,-0.1492999941110611,0.12157999724149704,-0.8349999785423279,-0.7652199864387512,-0.20413999259471893,0.2172199934720993,0.07232099771499634,0.2709200084209442,-0.16227999329566956,-0.15748000144958496,0.017376000061631203,0.6162999868392944,0.2983599901199341,1.5981999635696411,1.0311000347137451,0.6342999935150146,-0.19243000447750092,0.46316999197006226,-0.05468299984931946']"
304,Actor,"An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs ""in the flesh"" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally ""one who answers"". The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. This can also be considered an ""actor's role,"" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is ""playing themselves"", as in some forms of experimental performance art.","['actor,-0.6617400050163269,1.0199999809265137,-0.17757000029087067,-0.31617000699043274,0.6496999859809875,1.2122999429702759,-0.2998799979686737,-0.29923000931739807,-0.9875100255012512,1.0127999782562256,-0.03405100107192993,0.8403599858283997,-0.27772000432014465,0.8849400281906128,1.1327999830245972,-0.5396400094032288,0.737309992313385,0.7831599712371826,-1.0973000526428223,0.2842499911785126,-0.0729760006070137,1.3213000297546387,0.09269700199365616,0.5269100069999695,0.4576599895954132,-1.374400019645691,-0.4046199917793274,-0.46926000714302063,-0.7102400064468384,0.2589299976825714,1.6227999925613403,-0.32047998905181885,0.6282299757003784,-0.44290998578071594,0.8183599710464478,0.5127699971199036,0.23652000725269318,-0.011359999887645245,-0.4783500134944916,-0.9188100099563599,0.09902600198984146,2.2304000854492188,-0.34549999237060547,-1.1816999912261963,-0.6493200063705444,-0.7124199867248535,-0.2732200026512146,-1.0892000198364258,-0.322380006313324,1.3100999593734741']"

351,Feedback,"Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems:Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole. As provided by Webster, feedback in business is the transmission of evaluative or corrective information about an action, event, or process to the original or controlling source.","['feedback,0.6108400225639343,-0.10723999887704849,0.18956999480724335,0.26774001121520996,-0.44339999556541443,-0.12838000059127808,0.5517500042915344,0.536080002784729,0.4001699984073639,1.3286000490188599,0.5109500288963318,0.3698199987411499,0.4229699969291687,-0.015817999839782715,-0.7552199959754944,-0.08706299960613251,-0.26684999465942383,-0.012392000295221806,0.6883900165557861,-1.6247999668121338,0.5770599842071533,0.023382000625133514,0.38578999042510986,0.4482400119304657,1.2280999422073364,0.13350999355316162,-0.03316900134086609,-0.08094500005245209,-0.21741999685764313,-0.5213099718093872,2.4960999488830566,0.38065001368522644,0.03440200164914131,-1.4091999530792236,-0.26857998967170715,-0.23255999386310577,0.36924999952316284,-0.2330700010061264,0.011951000429689884,-0.05960499867796898,0.9840700030326843,-0.2188899964094162,-1.4084999561309814,0.6945499777793884,-0.10380999743938446,-0.9700899720191956,1.2891000509262085,1.1720999479293823,0.22571000456809998,0.800599992275238']"
352,Guitar,"The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.","['guitar,-1.3339999914169312,0.18694999814033508,-0.6205300092697144,-0.2770799994468689,-0.8028500080108643,0.9286400079727173,-0.8618500232696533,0.04638500139117241,-0.9534400105476379,1.1950000524520874,0.7443000078201294,0.9484599828720093,-0.6454300284385681,0.6587600111961365,-0.4623500108718872,-0.6636000275611877,-0.2402999997138977,0.29563000798225403,0.03324500098824501,-1.6128000020980835,-0.20055000483989716,0.7103400230407715,-0.23714999854564667,0.07152900099754333,0.7124199867248535,0.1386999934911728,-0.5292900204658508,0.020510999485850334,-0.06418299674987793,-0.7199000120162964,2.8573999404907227,-0.9502900242805481,0.849560022354126,0.5492100119590759,0.5270400047302246,0.859969973564148,0.7907400131225586,-0.3353300094604492,0.10987000167369843,0.25540998578071594,0.7444800138473511,0.7611100077629089,-1.2817000150680542,-0.560259997844696,0.48403000831604004,0.21116000413894653,0.8305000066757202,-0.8701099753379822,-1.6753000020980835,0.34516000747680664']"

358,Presentation,"A presentation conveys information from a speaker to an audience. Presentations are typically demonstrations, introduction, lecture, or speech meant to inform, persuade, inspire, motivate, build goodwill, or present a new idea/product. Presentations usually require preparation, organization, event planning, writing, use of visual aids, dealing with stress, and answering questions. “The key elements of a presentation consists of presenter, audience, message, reaction and method to deliver speech for organizational success in an effective manner.” Presentations are widely used in tertiary work settings such as accountants giving a detailed report of a company's financials or an entrepreneur pitching their venture idea to investors. The term can also be used for a formal or ritualized introduction or offering, as with the presentation of a debutante. Presentations in certain formats are also known as keynote address. Interactive presentations, in which the audience is involved, are also represented more and more frequently. Instead of a monologue, this creates a dialogue between the speaker and the audience. The advantages of an interactive presentation is for example, that it attracts more attention from the audience and that the interaction creates a sense of community.","['presentation,0.2690500020980835,0.5848100185394287,-0.821940004825592,0.5640900135040283,0.722100019454956,-0.08831799775362015,-0.009013400413095951,-0.7619799971580505,0.04676999896764755,0.5408899784088135,-0.34439998865127563,-0.41405999660491943,-0.053206998854875565,0.16808000206947327,0.536050021648407,-0.27344000339508057,-0.8582199811935425,-0.15127000212669373,-0.09738299995660782,-0.8220499753952026,0.9865000247955322,0.6137300133705139,-0.18991999328136444,-0.7294300198554993,0.3497700095176697,-0.18118000030517578,-0.6004899740219116,0.4290100038051605,-0.8883299827575684,-0.3567099869251251,2.15120005607605,0.05708499997854233,-0.2726899981498718,-0.9958800077438354,0.08608999848365784,0.037953998893499374,0.7316300272941589,0.7647200226783752,-0.7204300165176392,-0.8056100010871887,0.42945998907089233,-0.04145599901676178,-0.8673499822616577,-0.2773999869823456,-0.1812400072813034,-0.006293300073593855,0.737779974937439,0.8578600287437439,-0.0041518001817166805,0.5153599977493286']"

361,Refrigerator,"A refrigerator, colloquially fridge, is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C. A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half. The United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that the refrigerator be kept at or below 4 °C (40 °F) and that the freezer be regulated at −18 °C (0 °F).","['refrigerator,0.04475099965929985,0.22425000369548798,0.7452300190925598,-0.3926999866962433,0.7366399765014648,-0.08628399670124054,-0.010413000360131264,0.41628000140190125,0.5249000191688538,-0.1648399978876114,0.29205000400543213,-0.09555300325155258,0.6156600117683411,1.6019999980926514,0.4641000032424927,1.2692999839782715,-1.1416000127792358,0.8823699951171875,0.4770199954509735,-0.7894399762153625,1.5937000513076782,-0.34953001141548157,0.4256100058555603,0.5653700232505798,-0.32054001092910767,-0.5776000022888184,-0.39621999859809875,1.128999948501587,1.8284000158309937,-0.100040003657341,0.8267499804496765,0.4675599932670593,-0.23037000000476837,0.8069800138473511,0.5275300145149231,1.0271999835968018,0.21814000606536865,1.1405999660491943,1.4021999835968018,0.3093099892139435,0.5777400135993958,0.29989999532699585,-0.21301999688148499,-0.04646800085902214,0.07624199986457825,0.9161099791526794,0.47488999366760254,-0.5565299987792969,-0.451339989900589,0.04927600175142288']"

366,Tennis,"Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.","['tennis,-1.427299976348877,1.3487999439239502,-1.0119999647140503,1.7242000102996826,-0.8674799799919128,-1.1030000448226929,0.3708299994468689,0.806119978427887,-0.5016300082206726,-0.06283199787139893,0.30981001257896423,-0.6990799903869629,-1.1970000267028809,-0.04401800036430359,1.486899971961975,0.5019199848175049,0.0300929993391037,0.9568099975585938,-0.5888400077819824,-0.25067999958992004,-0.37018999457359314,0.6300699710845947,-0.7148799896240234,1.0406999588012695,-0.26763999462127686,-1.2599999904632568,-0.44102001190185547,-0.4802300035953522,-0.5939000248908997,-0.20946000516414642,2.0527000427246094,0.6973299980163574,0.33643001317977905,0.535830020904541,0.030301999300718307,0.6490700244903564,0.36371999979019165,1.4427000284194946,0.04111900180578232,-1.4665000438690186,0.4199199974536896,-0.38126999139785767,0.9681800007820129,0.8597400188446045,1.0575000047683716,0.33250999450683594,0.2712399959564209,-1.1438000202178955,-0.38745999336242676,-0.060123998671770096']"

379,Judgement,"Judgement is also known as adjudication, which means the evaluation of evidence to make a decision. Judgement is also the ability to make considered decisions. The term has at least five distinct uses. Aristotle suggested we think of the opposite of different uses of a term, if one exists, to help determine if the uses are really different. Some opposites will be included here to help demonstrate that their uses are really distinct:Informal – opinions expressed as facts.
Informal and psychological – used in reference to the quality of cognitive faculties and adjudicational capabilities of particular individuals, typically called wisdom or discernment. The opposites are foolishness or indiscretion.
Formal - the mental act of affirming or denying one thing of another through comparison. Judgements are communicated to others using agreed-upon terms in the form of words or algebraic symbols as meanings to form propositions relating the terms, and whose further asserted meanings ""of relation"" are interpreted by those trying to understand the judgement.
Legal – used in the context of legal trial, to refer to a final finding, statement, or ruling, based on a considered weighing of evidence, called, ""adjudication"". Opposites could be suspension or deferment of adjudication. See Judgment (law)#Spelling for further explanation.","['judgement,-0.3289499878883362,-0.6755099892616272,-0.9465500116348267,-0.3893199861049652,0.8603799939155579,-0.48350000381469727,1.4723999500274658,0.8488199710845947,0.2246199995279312,0.6809200048446655,-0.3476099967956543,0.4383699893951416,0.03462599962949753,-0.2580299973487854,0.45311999320983887,-0.26600000262260437,-0.2737500071525574,-1.0536999702453613,-0.036003001034259796,-0.38846999406814575,0.19855999946594238,0.4537400007247925,0.18456999957561493,-0.5789700150489807,0.5250800251960754,-0.8276699781417847,-0.48535001277923584,0.12257999926805496,-0.1526699960231781,0.2130800038576126,1.1407999992370605,-0.5249199867248535,-0.47971999645233154,-0.5217499732971191,0.16812999546527863,-0.2910900115966797,1.1198999881744385,-0.2027300000190735,0.035659998655319214,-0.5591199994087219,0.2918500006198883,-0.2797299921512604,-0.021090000867843628,0.8184900283813477,-1.1922999620437622,0.6697800159454346,0.1748500019311905,1.0674999952316284,0.9705899953842163,-0.2597300112247467']"

In other words, measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.
The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the International vocabulary of metrology published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

398,Tooth,"A tooth is a hard, calcified structure found in the jaws of many vertebrates and used to break down food. Some animals, particularly carnivores and omnivores, also use teeth to help with capturing or wounding prey, tearing food, for defensive purposes, to intimidate other animals often including their own, or to carry prey or their young. The roots of teeth are covered by gums. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness that originate from the embryonic germ layer, the ectoderm.","['tooth,0.1783200055360794,0.07586400210857391,-0.5424799919128418,-0.19550000131130219,0.7418199777603149,1.373900055885315,0.9386900067329407,-0.08410800248384476,0.5798599720001221,-0.44506001472473145,0.3309299945831299,0.2835499942302704,0.24315999448299408,-0.10954000055789948,-0.5082399845123291,0.7969800233840942,0.06738600134849548,-0.24908000230789185,-0.3283199965953827,0.18466000258922577,-0.812470018863678,-0.3888700008392334,0.9053099751472473,-1.0234999656677246,-0.19842000305652618,-0.2289399951696396,-1.301300048828125,0.5065199732780457,0.3233399987220764,-0.5966500043869019,1.5263999700546265,-0.32624000310897827,0.1958799958229065,0.8319299817085266,-0.29517000913619995,0.7427600026130676,0.4571399986743927,0.04235700145363808,1.2747999429702759,-0.8457800149917603,-0.2001499980688095,-0.841159999370575,-0.7349799871444702,0.888260006904602,1.0990999937057495,-0.1932699978351593,0.828719973564148,-0.4876599907875061,-0.033018000423908234,-0.948199987411499']"
